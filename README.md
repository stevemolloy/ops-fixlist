# Introduction
This web application provides a so-called fix-list for an operational system.  That is, a list of items that need to be fixed in order to allow the system to run at it's nominal settings, or to bring the operational risk back within reasonable bounds.

It was originally written with a large-scale particle accelerator in mind, however could easily be deployed at any complex facility.

# Tech stuff

The back-end uses an Express server as the API to a Mongo database.
